# MySQL & Relational Database Design

## Description
This project involves the design and implementation of a relational database for a hypothetical pizza restaurant. It includes the creation of tables to manage customers, menu items, and orders while enforcing relationships between these entities. Additionally, join tables were created to collect and sort specific data for efficient querying and reporting.

## Why?
A well-designed relational database is crucial for managing data effectively in any business. This project demonstrates the ability to create a structured database that can handle customer information, menu offerings, and order processing, ensuring data integrity and facilitating easy access to information.

## Quick Start
To explore the database design:
1. Download the SQL file containing the database schema.
2. Import the SQL file into a MySQL database management system (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
3. Review the tables and relationships defined in the SQL file.

## Usage
1. Once imported, you can query the database to retrieve information about customers, menu items, and orders.
2. Use join queries to analyze specific data, such as customer orders and their corresponding menu items.
